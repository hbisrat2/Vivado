Clock Divider + Top‑Level Demo

This project creates a slower derived clock (or clock‑enable pulse) from the board’s high‑frequency system clock. It forms the foundation for visible sequential demos like blinking LEDs or slow counters.

The divider is a synchronous counter whose output toggles at a programmed rate. The top‑level module often instantiates both the divider and a simple sequential circuit that consumes the divided clock.

Simulation confirms the expected division ratio by counting input cycles. FPGA implementation requires proper constraint mapping for the primary clock pin and reset input.
