Latches and Flip‑Flops

This project introduces storage elements, focusing on SR latches, D latches, and edge‑triggered D flip‑flops. These illustrate the difference between level‑sensitive and edge‑sensitive behavior.

Students learn how memory elements hold values between clock edges and how improper coding can accidentally infer unintended latches. Hierarchical construction of flip‑flops from gated latches reinforces timing concepts.

Simulation tests how Q responds when data changes at various times relative to enable or clock edges. FPGA notes emphasize using proper clock pins and ensuring no raw mechanical input directly drives a storage element without debouncing.
