4‑Bit ALU

This project integrates arithmetic and logic functions—addition, subtraction, bitwise operations—into a single 4‑bit module. Students learn how multiplexers and previously built adders combine to form a configurable datapath.

Inputs typically include the operands and an opcode, while outputs include the 4‑bit result and optional flags such as carry, zero, or overflow. The ALU is mostly structural: each operation is computed in parallel, then a multiplexer selects the active result.

Simulation checks each operation with directed tests, including edge cases. On the FPGA the ALU is often driven from switches with the result displayed on LEDs, providing a hands‑on view of multi‑function datapath behavior.
